# Health Tracker Application

## Overview
This Health Tracker application allows users to set daily health goals, track progress, and maintain a healthy lifestyle through a user-friendly web interface. The application is designed to support individual health management with a focus on user engagement and data privacy.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:**
  - **React:** Used for building the user interface with interactive components.
  - **React Router:** Manages navigation between different parts of the application.
  - **Axios:** Handles HTTP requests to the backend API.
  - **React Icons:** Provides icons for the user interface for better visual engagement.

- **Backend:**
  - **Node.js:** The runtime environment for running JavaScript on the server.
  - **Express:** Framework used to build the backend structure, providing a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications.
  - **Mongoose:** An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js that manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and is used to translate between objects in code and their representation in MongoDB.
  - **MongoDB:** The NoSQL database used to store user data and health metrics securely.
  - **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** Method for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object, used here for authentication.
  - **bcrypt.js:** Library to hash passwords before storing them in the database.

- **Other Tools:**
  - **Postman:** Used for testing API endpoints.
  - **react-toastify:** Provides notifications in the UI for success or error messages.

## API Endpoints

### User Authentication

- **POST /api/v1/login**
  - **Description:** Authenticates a user and returns a JWT.
  - **Payload:**
    ```json
    {
      "email": "user@example.com",
      "password": "yourpassword"
    }
    ```
  - **Success Response:**
    ```json
    {
      "message": "Login successful",
      "token": "JWT_TOKEN_HERE",
      "userId": "user_id_here"
    }
    ```

- **POST /api/v1/register**
  - **Description:** Registers a new user and returns a JWT.
  - **Payload:**
    ```json
    {
      "username": "newuser",
      "email": "newuser@example.com",
      "password": "newpassword"
    }
    ```
  - **Success Response:**
    ```json
    {
      "message": "User registered successfully",
      "token": "JWT_TOKEN_HERE"
    }
    ```

### Health Metrics

- **POST /api/goals**
  - **Description:** Sets or updates user's health goals.
  - **Required Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer JWT_TOKEN_HERE`
  - **Payload:**
    ```json
    {
      "userId": "user_id_here",
      "steps": 10000,
      "calories": 2500,
      "sleepHours": 8,
      "waterConsumed": 3
    }
    ```
  - **Success Response:**
    ```json
    {
      "message": "Goals updated successfully",
      "goals": {
        "steps": 10000,
        "calories": 2500,
        "sleepHours": 8,
        "waterConsumed": 3
      }
    }
    ```

## Authentication Details

Authentication is handled using JWTs. Upon successful login or registration, a JWT is generated server-side using the `jsonwebtoken` package. The token is then sent to the client, which must store this token (commonly in localStorage) and provide it in the `Authorization` header for all subsequent requests requiring authentication.

## Middleware Implementation

Middleware is extensively used in this project for various purposes:
- **Error Handling:** Centralized error handling middleware to catch and respond to errors uniformly.
- **Authentication Middleware:** Validates JWTs provided in request headers to secure protected routes.
- **Logging Middleware:** Logs incoming requests to help with debugging and monitoring.

## Storing Tokens

The JWT provided after login or registration is stored in the client's localStorage. This approach is taken to maintain user sessions. The token is then included in the `Authorization` header for API requests that require authentication.
